To run my code open ".rmd" file in RStudio and 'knit' the file. Please make sure that data files "optdigits.tra" and "optdigits.tes" are in the same folder as the .rmd file. Approx time to run 3 hours on a quad-core cpu.
Required R packages:
	H2O
	mxnet
	magrittr
	data.table

The results are attached in the file lab2.pdf.
For any questions email me usinghATiastate.edu.
